I wanted to do an Angular version but I realised it is not possible to satisfy the brief with Angular. 

This is because IE8 support is required, which means angaular 1.2, but accessibility is required, which means ngAria which is only available in 1.3!. So react it is.

I chose a yeoman format that I liked for a react project. This has nice separation of preprocessed and www assets and all the functional guff in between. It does grunt build and grunt test, thought the testing is only a karma scaffold at present.

There is plenty I would like to do to this, but time does not allow since (doh!) I only started last night. I hope you enjoy this, my first foray into react and not my last :)
